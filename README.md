# Typing Speed Test

A web-based Typing Speed Test application that measures a user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM). Users can start the test, type out a random paragraph accurately, and receive their typing speed as feedback upon completion.

## Features

- **Random Paragraphs**: Each test provides a randomly chosen paragraph from a set of predefined text samples.
- **Typing Speed Calculation**: The application calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the time taken to type the paragraph accurately.
- **Interactive UI**: Start and submit buttons toggle to enable users to begin and complete the test, showing their results instantly.
- **Error Prompt**: Users are required to complete the paragraph correctly for the test to submit.

## Built With

- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content and interactivity
